# The Language Game
A client-side game to practice Japanese Hiragana syllables.

## Motivation
Practicing writing Hiragana syllables in a fixed sequence was a rote learning process. The mind went blank when a random syllable was asked to be written.

## How to practice?
This game randomly displays a syllable from a set of 15 Hiragan syllables for an infinite duration once you hit the start button.
The delay between each syllable is set to a default of 5 seconds, however the speed can be set in seconds using the input field below the syllable viewport.

If you know the syllable, hit any key on the keyboard while the game is progressing.
This will record the score. Once done with the game, click the stop button and check the scoreboard.

## Interpreting the scoreboard
The syllables with the highest value are the ones you tend to not answer the most.
They require more practice compared to the ones with lower scores.
